# Abstract

We introduce RoboVisAR, an immersive augmented reality (AR) au- thoring tool for in-situ robot visualisations. AR robot visualisations, such as the robotâ€™s movement path, status, and safety zones, have been shown to benefit human-robot collaboration. However, their creation requires extensive skills in both robotics and AR program- ming. To address this, RoboVisAR allows users to create custom AR robot visualisations without programming. By recording an example robot behaviour, users can design, combine, and test visu- alisations in-situ within a mixed reality environment. RoboVisAR currently supports six types of visualisations (Path, Point of Interest, Safety Zone, Robot State, Message, Force/Torque) and four types of conditions for when they are displayed (Robot State, Proximity, Box, Force/Torque). With this tool, users can easily present different visualisations on demand and make them context-aware to avoid visual clutter. An expert user study with three participants sug- gests that users appreciate the customizability of the visualisations, which could easily be authored in less than ten minutes.
